# Part 1 · 1 — Research Mindset for Security

## Core ideas
- Problem framing → decision, payoff, uncertainty
- Hypotheses → falsifiable, minimal, decision-linked
- Data classes → observables, proxies, counterfactuals

## What we need
- Clear decision statements
- Measurable outcomes
- Baseline assumptions (priors) to update later

## Outputs
- Decision statement template
- Hypothesis template (null/alt + success criteria)
