# Part 1 · 2 — Operationalization & Metrics

## From concept to measurement
- Define constructs → observable metrics
- Validity & reliability (face, content, convergent)
- “North star” vs leading indicators

## Measurement patterns
- Binary, count, rate, time-to-event (survival)
- Heavy tails & medians
- Guardrails (e.g., latency, false positives)

## Checklist
- Outcome definition
- Metric formula + unit
- Sampling window
- Known biases + mitigations

:::{tip}
We’ll reuse these metrics in Monte Carlo sims and Bayes updates.
