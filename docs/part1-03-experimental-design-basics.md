# Part 1 · 3 — Experimental Design Basics

## Designs we can run
- A/B, switchback, staggered rollout
- Before/after (with controls) vs simple pre/post
- Power & sample size (intuitions first)

## Threats to validity
- Selection, drift, seasonality, interference
- Novelty & adoption effects

## Minimal plan
- Assignment, randomization, units
- Primary metric, guardrails
- Duration and decision rule
